I also go by Celia (which has a pronunciation similar to my nickname in Cantonese). I was born in Guangzhou, China, and moved to California during my high school years. Traveling has always been one of my greatest passions, and I relish the opportunity to explore new places and cultures.\

When I'm not on the road, I can often be found in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and cooking techniques:
